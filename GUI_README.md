# PDF Label Processor GUI

A graphical user interface for processing PDF files and rearranging pages based on SKU labels.

## Features

- **Easy File Selection**: Browse and select input PDF files with a user-friendly interface
- **Automatic Output Naming**: Automatically generates output filename based on input file
- **Real-time Processing Log**: See detailed progress of the PDF processing
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual progress bar shows processing status
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and validation
- **Threaded Processing**: GUI remains responsive during PDF processing

## Installation

1. **Activate your virtual environment** (if using one):
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Method 1: Using the Launcher Script (Recommended)
```bash
python run_gui.py
```

### Method 2: Direct Execution
```bash
python pdf_gui.py
```

## How to Use the GUI

1. **Launch the Application**: Run one of the commands above

2. **Select Input File**: 
   - Click "Browse" next to "Input PDF File"
   - Select your PDF file
   - The output filename will be automatically generated

3. **Customize Output** (Optional):
   - Click "Browse" next to "Output PDF File" to change the output location
   - Or keep the auto-generated filename

4. **Process the PDF**:
   - Click "Process PDF" button
   - Watch the progress in the log area
   - Wait for completion

5. **View Results**:
   - A success message will appear when processing is complete
   - The processed PDF will be saved to your chosen location

## GUI Features

### File Selection
- **Input PDF**: Select the PDF file you want to process
- **Output PDF**: Choose where to save the processed file (auto-generated by default)

### Processing Controls
- **Process PDF Button**: Starts the processing operation
- **Progress Bar**: Shows processing status
- **Status Label**: Displays current status messages

### Log Area
- **Real-time Logging**: See detailed information about each step
- **Scrollable**: View all log entries even for large files
- **Clear Log**: Button to clear the log area

## Processing Logic

The GUI uses the same processing logic as your original script:

1. **Page Analysis**: Scans each page for SKU information
2. **Label Detection**: Identifies pages with quantities > 1 or non-TN0001 SKUs
3. **Page Rearrangement**: Moves marked pages to the end
4. **Label Addition**: Adds visual labels to marked pages
5. **Output Generation**: Creates the final processed PDF

## SKU Mapping

The application uses the following SKU to product name mapping:
- `TN0001` → "OIL"
- `TN0002` → "Potli"
- `TN003` → "Rollon"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" error**:
   - Make sure you have write permissions in the output directory
   - Try running with administrator privileges if needed

2. **"File not found" error**:
   - Ensure the input PDF file exists and is accessible
   - Check file path for special characters

3. **Processing fails**:
   - Check the log area for detailed error messages
   - Ensure the PDF is not corrupted or password-protected

4. **GUI doesn't start**:
   - Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check that tkinter is available (usually comes with Python)

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the processing log for error details
2. Verify your PDF file format and content
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
4. Try processing a smaller PDF file first

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: tkinter (built-in Python GUI library)
- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF (fitz)
- **Threading**: Background processing to keep GUI responsive
- **File Handling**: Native Python file operations with error handling
